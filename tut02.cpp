// The comments below provide explanations for the different parts of the code.

// Header files are used to include external libraries and declare functions before using them.
// In this case, the iostream header provides functionality for input and output streams.

// The "using namespace std;" directive allows you to access standard library functions and objects
// without explicitly specifying the "std::" prefix each time you use them.

// The "main()" function is the entry point of the program where execution begins.
// It has an "int" return type, indicating that it should return an integer value.

// The opening curly brace "{" marks the beginning of the main function's block.
// The block contains the actual code and statements that the program executes.

// Inside the main function's block, you can write the logic of your program.
// This is where you handle input from the user, perform calculations, and generate output.

// The "return 0;" statement indicates that the program has completed successfully.
// Returning 0 from the "main" function is a common convention to indicate success.

// The closing curly brace "}" marks the end of the main function's block.
// It separates the scope of the main function from the rest of the code.

// Overall, this basic structure forms the foundation of many C++ programs.
// You build upon this structure by adding your specific code and logic to achieve your program's goals.
